# Core AWS Services:

1. AWS Lambda
2. AWS Dynamo
3. AWS Hosting and Deployment (EC2, ElasticBeanstalk)
4. Others

To work on these projects, you will need to set up the AWS CLI and sign into AWS with your IDE of choice. Since you are developing locally (on your own computer) you will need to use the AWS CLI to get our TIW secret API keys from AWS Secrets Manager.

## Setting up the AWS CLI

1. Visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html

aws --version
